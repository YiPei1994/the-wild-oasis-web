# The Wild Oasis

This project allows users to manage reservations for a fictional oasis experience. Users can:

* **Log in** using a Google provider for secure authentication.
* **Make reservations** on specific dates and timeslots within the timeline.
* **Manage reservations (CRUD operations)**: view, create, update, and delete their own reservations.

**Motivation:**

This project serves as a practice ground for exploring:

* **Next.js App Routes with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Server Actions:** This approach allows for dynamic content generation and data fetching.
* **New React Hooks:**
    * `useFormStatus`: Likely used for managing form validation and submission states.
    * `useTransitions`:  Potentially used for handling UI animations or state transitions.
    * `useOpmitics`: Might be a custom hook or a third-party library for tracking user interactions or website analytics.

**Technologies Used:**

* Next.js: A React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications.
* Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
* TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing for improved code maintainability.
* Supabase: A full-featured open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform for managing databases, authentication, and storage.

**Quick start:**

* clone the repo
* cd repo and npm install
* npm run dev
